**Subject: Add File Upload Feature to DataSphere Navigator Agent**

**Request**

I am currently developing a "DataSphere Navigator" Agent. The detailed design document for this agent can be found in `agent_design_document.md`. I have already completed some of the initial code.

My goal is to enhance the existing Gradio UI by adding a file upload feature. This will enable users to directly upload their own data files for analysis.

To implement this, you will likely need to update the agent's prompt design and its associated Tool definitions to handle the uploaded files.

Please review the design document and the current codebase carefully, and then implement the necessary changes to add this file upload functionality.
