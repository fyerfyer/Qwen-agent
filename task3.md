I am experiencing issues while deploying a model according to the instructions in `model_deployment_guide.md`. My cloud server crashed during the deployment process. Here are the specifications of my server:

```
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS
- GPU: 1x NVIDIA Tesla T4 (15360MiB VRAM)
- CPU: 8x Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8255C CPU @ 2.50GHz
- CUDA: 12.4
- Python: 3.10.11
- PyTorch: 2.5.1+cu124

I have already uploaded the `model_deployment_guide.md` file to you.

**Task:**
Please analyze my cloud server information and the model deployment instructions in `model_deployment_guide.md`. Determine whether the issue is caused by my choice of model, the deployment method, or something else. Then, generate a detailed Markdown document that describes a comprehensive solution to this problem.

**Requirements:**
- Carefully review both my server specs and the deployment guide.
- Identify any potential mismatches or issues (e.g., model too large for GPU, missing swap, etc.).
- Provide a step-by-step solution, including any configuration changes, model selection advice, or deployment method adjustments.
- Present your answer as a well-structured Markdown document.

**Note:** You do not need to solve the problem for meâ€”just generate the Markdown document with the analysis and solution as described above.
